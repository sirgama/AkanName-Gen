## Description
<p>This is a simple web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. <br>

Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.</p>
